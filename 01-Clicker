This file will contain the respective files of my first attempt on creating a Clicker game from scratch.

Goal: User earns gold by clicking on idling on the game. 
Rules: 
  1. User can't buy purchases if the amount of gold is not enough.
  2. User needs to buy upgrades to earn more resources.
  3. User can save its current progress.

Success: user completes all levels, unblocks all upgrades and gets to 999 gold.
